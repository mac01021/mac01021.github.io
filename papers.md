I have contributed content and support to the following papers. I will try to
post a copy of each publication in the future.

- [2010] Hybrid Kalman algorithms for very short-term load forecasting and
  confidence interval estimation (Guan, C., Luh, P. B., Michel, L. D., Coolbeth, M. A.,
  & Friedland, P. B.), In Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2010 IEEE,
  volume , 2010.

- [2010] Short-Term Load Forecasting: Similar Day-Based Wavelet Neural Networks
